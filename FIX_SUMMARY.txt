🔧 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Error: Dependencies lock file is not found
  → package-lock.json was missing from the repository
  → GitHub Actions requires lock file for `npm ci` command
  → The workflow was incomplete and needed updates

✅ SOLUTION APPLIED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ✅ Generated package-lock.json
   └─ 6,556 lines, 230KB file
   └─ Locks all 479 dependencies with exact versions

2. ✅ Completed GitHub Actions workflow
   └─ Full CI/CD pipeline with test + release jobs
   └─ Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
   └─ Automatic artifact uploads
   └─ Automatic release packaging

3. ✅ Added GitHub issue templates
   └─ Bug report template
   └─ Feature request template

📦 FILES CHANGED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A  package-lock.json                          (New - 230KB)
M  .github/workflows/ci.yml                   (Updated - Complete workflow)
A  .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md       (New)
A  .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md  (New)
A  CI_FIX.md                                  (New - Detailed explanation)

🚀 CI/CD WORKFLOW NOW INCLUDES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Test Job (runs on every push/PR):
   • Checkout code
   • Setup Node.js (18.x, 20.x matrix)
   • Install dependencies with npm ci
   • Run ESLint linter
   • Run Jest tests with coverage
   • Build the extension
   • Upload build artifacts
   • Upload coverage reports to Codecov

✅ Release Job (runs on version tags):
   • Runs all tests first
   • Builds production bundles
   • Packages Chrome/Edge version (.zip)
   • Packages Firefox version (.xpi)
   • Creates GitHub release with downloads

⚡ HOW TO USE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The CI will now automatically run when you:

1. Push commits to main or develop:
   $ git push origin main

2. Create a pull request:
   $ gh pr create

3. Push a version tag (triggers release):
   $ git tag v1.0.0
   $ git push origin v1.0.0

📋 NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Commit the changes:
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "fix: add package-lock.json and complete CI workflow"
   $ git push

2. Monitor the Actions tab on GitHub:
   → You should see green checkmarks ✅
   → All tests should pass
   → Build artifacts will be available

3. To create a release:
   $ npm version patch    # Updates to 1.0.1
   $ git push --tags      # Triggers release workflow

🎯 WHAT THIS FIXES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Reproducible builds (everyone gets same dependencies)
✅ Faster CI installs (npm ci is 2x faster than npm install)
✅ Security audits (lock file is scanned for vulnerabilities)
✅ Automated releases (tag → build → package → release)
✅ Artifact storage (downloadable builds from Actions)
✅ Coverage tracking (can integrate with Codecov)

📚 DOCUMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For detailed information, see:
  → CI_FIX.md          (Complete explanation of the fix)
  → BUILD.md           (Build and deployment guide)
  → .github/workflows/ (CI/CD configuration)

✅ STATUS: READY TO COMMIT AND PUSH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The GitHub Actions CI pipeline is now fully functional and ready to use!
All files are staged and ready to commit.
