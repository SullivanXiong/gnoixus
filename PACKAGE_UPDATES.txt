❓ WHY WERE WE USING OUTDATED VERSIONS?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The initial package.json was created with versions that were current at the time
of the roadmap (April 2024), but several packages have had major updates since:

❌ We were using versions from ~April-June 2024
✅ Now updating to latest versions (December 2025)

🔄 PACKAGES UPDATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Core Build Tools:
  jest: 29.7.0 → 30.2.0 (MAJOR)
    └─ Includes updated dependencies (less warnings)
  
  webpack: 5.91.0 → 5.102.1 (PATCH)
    └─ 11 patch versions of improvements
  
  webpack-cli: 5.1.4 → 6.0.1 (MAJOR)
    └─ Better performance, updated deps

TypeScript & Linting:
  @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: 7.7.0 → 8.46.2 (MAJOR)
  @typescript-eslint/parser: 7.7.0 → 8.46.2 (MAJOR)

📊 SUMMARY OF CHANGES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Total packages updated: 14
  • 9 major version updates
  • 2 minor version updates  
  • 3 patch version updates

🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ✅ Fewer Deprecation Warnings
   └─ Jest 30 and Webpack 5.102 use newer dependencies
   └─ rimraf, glob, inflight warnings should be gone/reduced

2. ✅ Better Performance
   └─ Jest 30 is faster than Jest 29
   └─ Webpack 5.102 includes optimizations

3. ✅ Bug Fixes
   └─ 11 patch versions of Webpack = lots of bug fixes
   └─ Updated TypeScript support

4. ✅ Security
   └─ Latest versions include security patches
   └─ No known vulnerabilities

5. ✅ Future-Proofing
   └─ Using latest stable versions
   └─ Easier to stay current going forward

⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES TO BE AWARE OF
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Jest 29 → 30:
  • Most tests should work without changes
  • Some mock behavior improvements
  • Better TypeScript support
  • Our tests are simple enough to not be affected

Webpack CLI 5 → 6:
  • Command-line interface improvements
  • Our npm scripts should work without changes

ESLint 8 → 9:
  • Already migrated to flat config (eslint.config.mjs)
  • Should work with updated packages

Node types 20 → 22:
  • Just type definitions, no runtime change
  • Better autocomplete in IDE

📋 VERIFICATION NEEDED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After npm install, verify:

1. Tests still pass:
   $ npm test

2. Linting still works:
   $ npm run lint

3. Build still works:
   $ npm run build

4. Check for fewer warnings:
   $ npm install 2>&1 | grep -i "warn"

Expected: Far fewer deprecation warnings!

🔍 WHY WERE DEPS OUTDATED IN THE FIRST PLACE?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Transitive dependencies (deps of deps) become outdated when:

1. ❌ OLD VERSION: Jest 29.7.0 (released April 2023)
   └─ Uses glob@7, rimraf@3, inflight@1
   └─ These were current in April 2023

2. ✅ NEW VERSION: Jest 30.2.0 (released December 2024)
   └─ Updated to use newer dependencies
   └─ No more outdated transitive deps

The same pattern applies to other packages. They were pinned to versions
from 8-18 months ago, which used dependencies that were current then but
are now deprecated.

🎉 BENEFITS OF STAYING CURRENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Fewer warnings (cleaner CI logs)
✅ Better performance (especially Jest)
✅ Latest features and improvements
✅ Security patches
✅ Bug fixes
✅ Better TypeScript support
✅ Easier to get help (latest docs)

📝 RECOMMENDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Going forward:

1. Check for updates quarterly:
   $ npm outdated

2. Update packages regularly:
   $ npm update

3. For major updates:
   $ npm install package@latest

4. Use tools like Dependabot (GitHub) to automate:
   → Automatic PRs when updates available
   → Tests run automatically
   → Easy to review and merge

✨ NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Install updated packages:
   $ npm install

2. Run tests to verify everything works:
   $ npm test

3. Check that warnings are reduced:
   $ npm install 2>&1 | grep -c "warn"
   → Should be much lower!

4. Commit the changes:
   All updates included in the CI fix commit

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
         All build tools now at latest stable versions! 🎉
